# Dog is dependent on the logic calling its constructor to provide a tail, or else the
# chase_bunnies() method won't have a tail to delegate to - Perl 5:

package Dog;

use Attribute::Property;

sub tail :Property;
sub new  :New;
sub chase_bunnies {
    my $_ = shift;
    $_->tail->chase_bunnies;
}
