# Dog is dependent on logic calling its constructor to provide a tail, and
# the lack of a tail is tested for - Perl 5:

package Dog;

use Attribute::Property;
use Carp 'confess';

sub tail :Property;
sub new  :New {
    my $_ = shift;
    print "debug: @_\n";
    confess "tail is required" unless defined $_->tail;
    $_;
};
sub chase_bunnies {
    my $_ = shift;
    $_->tail->chase_bunnies;
}
